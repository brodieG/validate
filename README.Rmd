## Declarative Checks with Templates

### Templates

Declare a template that an object should conform to, and let `vetr` take care of
the rest:

```{r}
tpl <- numeric(1L)
vet(tpl, 1:3)
vet(tpl, "hello")
vet(tpl, 42)
```

`vetr` supports complex recursive templates:

```{r}
tpl <- list(numeric(1L), list(dat=matrix(numeric(), 3), mode=character(1L)))
```

That can be used to vet complex objects:

```{r}
## Make some objects
obj1 <- list(42, list(cbind(1:5, 1:5, 1:5), "foo"))          # missing names
obj2 <- list(42, list(dat=cbind(1:5, 1:5, 1:5), mode="foo")) # dat transposed
obj3 <- list(42, list(dat=rbind(1:5, 1:5, 1:5), mode="foo")) # correct
## Vet them:
vet(tpl, obj1)
vet(tpl, obj2)
vet(tpl, obj3)
```

The auto-generated error message tells you:

* what the (sub-)object should be
* what it is
* the exact point of failure (e.g. `obj2[[2]]$dat`)

The point of failure is expressed such that you can copy and paste it into the
prompt to directly examine the problem.

### Vetting Expressions

You can augment templates with custom vetting tokens to check values with `.`:

```{r}
vet(numeric(1L) && . > 0, -42)
vet(numeric(1L) && . > 0, 42)
```

And you can compose vetting expressions as language objects and combine them:

```{r}
scalar.num.pos <- quote(numeric(1L) && . > 0)
foo.or.bar <- quote(character(1L) && . %in% c('foo', 'bar'))
vet.exp <- quote(scalar.num.pos || foo.or.bar)

vet(vet.exp, 42)
vet(vet.exp, "foo")
vet(vet.exp, "baz")
```

See [vignette][1] for additional details.

## Vetting Function Parameters

If you are vetting function inputs, you can use the `vetr` function, which works
just like `vet` except that it is streamlined for use within functions:

```{r}
fun <- function(x, y) {
  vetr(numeric(1L), logical(1L))
  TRUE   # do work...
}
fun(1:2, "foo")
fun(1, "foo")
```

`vetr` automatically matches the vetting expressions to the corresponding
arguments and fetches the argument values from the function environment.

## Installation

`vetr` is available on CRAN.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages('vetr')
```

* [valaddin](https://github.com/egnha/valaddin) by Eugene Ha (see vignette for a
  more detailed comparison) has very similar objectives to `vetr`
* [ensurer](https://github.com/smbache/ensurer) by Stefan M Bache allows you to
  specify contracts for data validation and has an experimental implementation
  of type-safe functions.
* [validate](https://github.com/data-cleaning/validate) by Mark van der Loo and
  Edwin de Jonge provides tools for checking data
* [types](https://github.com/jimhester/types) by Jim Hester provides a mechanism
  for defining what types arguments should be, though it does not directly
  enforce them

  parameter checks via Roxygen (not published to CRAN)
